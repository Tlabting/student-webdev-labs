### HTML

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I followed along with the video, I find that starting out by following tutorials is really compatible with how I learn.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I found them helpful for a beginner. I haven't really touched HTML in 15 years.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  No.

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

  Not that I can thing of.

### Accessibility

I'm really glad that we are going to learn how to make our websites accessible from the get go, because I feel like accessibility has not been as much of a focus as it should be in regards to our projects so far. Often times, it has felt like accessibility is only being done as an afterthought to meet some kind of requirement, instead of genuinely trying to make things equitably accessible.
